I am aiming to make an app that collects specific tweets from Donald
Trump's feed and redistributes those tweets to a set of different
profile pictures based on their content. This is meant to highlight
the strange capitulations in his character, and play ironically on
all the contradictory things he says. The tweets will be chosen by
targeting specific words, as they relate to a topic. For example he
has just recently tweeted “On International Women's Day, join me in
honouring the role of women here in America and around the world”.
I find this extremely hypocritical coming from a man who has no shame
is saying what he grabs women by... So maybe in this instance this
tweet would be reposted next to an image of Buffalo Bill, the serial
killer from Silence of the Lambs (ok, maybe I won't go _that_
far). It may seem a little bit ridiculous, but that is just how
anachronistic (and dangerous) Donald Trump really is.  

It's a fitting result that America's President should
be the ultimate Spectacle; he is truly a man with a thousand faces,
so why not expose these idiosyncrasies. He's certainly perfected
DoubleSpeak; I cannot count the number of instances he has said one
thing and only to express the exact opposite in a matter of days. I
want to find personas to match his most hyperbolic moments and post
those pictures side by side with the content of his tweet. For
example when he says Obamacare is imploding but Republicans will save
the day, show it next to a picture of Jack Bauer (character from a TV
series). Or when he says something really absurd (i.e. regarding
Russia or Democrats hacking the election) post it next to a picture
of the character from the cartoon Red Meat.  All in all, it is
supposed to make people wonder, this is the leader of the free world,
but how do we take him seriously? It is scary to think that we have
to. 

I could see some barriers to doing a project like this.
I read twitter's policy and I am not sure I am allowed to use an
alternate picture linked in association with Trump's content. If
nothing else I could target and repost the most divisive/inane
content together under a profile that was using a caricature of his
actual appearance and had an ironic title. I would start by targeting
keywords like “Obama”, “Women”, “Russia”, “Refugee”,
“Illegal” and let's not forget “Wall”.

I ultimately want to have these types of tweets
displayed consecutively to point out how inflammatory his personality
really is.  The accessibility to and publicity of these types of
views is disconcerting to say the least, and that they are
furthermore being normalized as attributes of the man holding the
highest office in the United States, well that's just a tragedy
(+time=comedy). To that end I am trying to make this project
satirical.

Just reading through his tweets I am specifically
humoured by all of his references to the “fake news media” of
which I think he is an integral part. When you see it all together in
a single stream of unfounded accusations and unprefaced assertions,
it kind of makes him look like he has a very serious separation from
reality. The work has really been done for me, I just have to find a
way to juxtapose his content in a meaningful way.  

Alternatively this app could repost his tweets, and
show the responding tweets from other parties regarding the issue, in
order to outline how inaccurate he is. He had one post: “ SEE YOU
IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE”. This was in
response to the multiple court rulings striking down his travel ban
as being unlawful. There was a really funny tweet in response, by a
member of the legal team that fought against the travel ban, who said
“Mr. President, We just saw you in court, and we beat you.”
Later on I wouldn't mind building on this project to make a Trump
Translator!
